# 📊 Sales & Finance Analytics Project

## 🚀 Project Objectives:
1. Analyze customer performance using sales data.
2. Evaluate country-wise financial performance through a Profit & Loss (P&L) report.
3. Track Gross Margin Percentage (GM%) trends across quarters.

## 🧠 Project Overview:
This project is designed to help stakeholders gain deeper insights into customer behavior, financial outcomes by region, and profitability trends over time. Using Microsoft Excel's advanced analytics features, I developed three key reports:
- *Customer Sales Report*: Highlights customer performance based on sales volume and value.
- *P&L by Country*: Displays revenue, cost, and profit breakdowns across different markets.
- *GM% by Quarter*: Tracks gross margin trends to assess profitability over time.

## 🎯 Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is to enable better strategic decision-making by providing data-backed insights. With clear visualizations and KPIs, the reports help identify areas for growth, underperforming regions, and optimal pricing strategies.

## 💡 Why This Analysis Matters:
- Identifies high-performing and low-performing customer segments.
- Allows comparison of profitability between countries.
- Enables finance and sales teams to monitor quarterly margin performance.
- Supports budgeting, planning, and forecasting initiatives.

- Created custom Date Tables and derived Fiscal Quarters
- Built relationships using Power Pivot for integrated data models
- Used DAX to create calculated columns for KPIs like GM%
- Integrated multiple data sources for a unified reporting experience

## 🤝 Soft Skills & Report Design:
